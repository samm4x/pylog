# Pylog {WIP v0.4}

- A lightweight log checker written in Python. 

- Finds errors in a log file and stores them with a line number in "found_errors.txt" to easily find errors in the past.

- Adds a message in the log when the files have been checked.

- Easily edited: all code in "main.py"

- Updates coming soon!

### Try it out with an example log: https://repl.it/github/samm4x/pylog set "run" to "main.py" in the file ".replit"
